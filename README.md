#PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

##Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on the PyBer ride sharing data to understand the difference in ridership in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities.  This will help to determine trends and identify key targets for improvements to PyBer market performance.

##Results
Through analyzing the number of rides, the number of drivers, and the fare amounts in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities I have found the following data:

•	Urban cities have the greatest number of rides and drivers

•	Urban cities have the greatest total fares, but the lowest average fares

•	Rural cities have the greatest average fares and the greatest average fare per driver

##Summary
The data indicates that there are more drivers and rides available in Urban cities resulting in more revenue for PyBer.  It also indicates that the typical rides in Rural cities result in higher fares most likely due to longer times/distances per ride.

Recommendations based on this data:

1.	Hire more drivers in Rural cities that could result in more rides with longer distances.
	
2.	Hire more drivers in Suburban cities that could result in more rides in those areas.

3.	Increase fares in Urban cities to maximize the areas with the highest ridership.
